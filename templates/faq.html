            How does copy trading work?
          </button>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select
              an expert or experts that you want to copy trades from. Once you
              are signed up, this is the only action needed on your part.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no
              codes that you need to run or signals for you to manually input.
              Our software will handle the trade copying automatically on your
              behalf. We monitor your experts trading activity and as soon as
              there is a trade, we calculate all the necessary parameters and
              execute the trade.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough
              available base currency that your expert trades with, in your
              trading account. How much is enough? First, you must meet the
              exchanges minimum order amount (let’s say about $10 per trade to
              be safe). That means that if your expert executes a 5% order, you
              must have at least $300 in your account total value (at 100%
              expert allocation as an example). This also means that you need to
              have at least 10% or higher in available base currency to avoid
              missed trades.
            </p>

            <p>
              When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it.
              Automatically. You can also change allocation at any time.

            A quote session is a period when the platform receives and transmits
            quotes. However, one can make trades within a slightly shorter
            trading session, which is part of a quote session. As a rule, a
            quote session starts 5-10 minutes earlier and ends 5-10 minutes
            later than the trading session. This is meant to protect traders
            from the risk of high volatility at the beginning and the end of the
            quote session. For example, a quote session for Apple shares starts
            at 13:30 GMT (US Summer Time) and ends at 20:00. A trading session
            for Apple shares starts with a five-minute delay, i.e. at 13:35. And
            it ends at 19:55, which is 5 minutes before the quote session ends.
